## Component Analysis

### 1. Semantic Component: 辵/辶 (chuò) - Walking Radical

The **辵** radical (simplified to 辶) indicates movement or travel.

**Seal Script Structure of 辵:**
- Composed of 彳 (chì, "to walk") + 止 (zhǐ, "to stop")
- Meaning: "乍行乍止" - to walk and stop alternately
- In seal script, this appears as a continuous flowing form on the left/bottom

**Key Features in Seal Script:**
1. **Upper element**: A small dot or short stroke (点)
2. **Middle element**: A curved vertical stroke descending (弯曲竖)
3. **Lower element**: A horizontal sweeping stroke extending right (横捺)

### 2. Phonetic Component: 禺 (yú) - Monkey Pictograph

The **禺** component provides the sound (yù) and originated as a pictograph of a macaque/monkey.

**Evolution of 禺:**
- **Oracle Bone (甲骨文)**: Depicted a monkey figure with head, body, and tail
- **Bronze (金文)**: Shows 甲 (face/mask) + 又 (hand) = "wearing a mask" or grasping gesture
- **Seal Script (小篆)**: Stylized form with head at top, body in middle, legs at bottom

**Seal Script Structure of 禺:**
1. **Head/Top (田 shape)**: A rectangular box representing the monkey's head/face
2. **Body (用 shape)**: Vertical lines through the center with internal horizontals
3. **Legs (八/儿)**: Two diverging strokes at the bottom representing legs

## Seal Script Characteristics to Follow

### Line Quality (线条特征)
- **Uniform thickness** (粗细均匀): All strokes should have consistent width
- **Smooth curves** (圆润): Gentle, flowing curves rather than sharp angles
- **Symmetry** (对称): The character should be balanced and symmetrical

### Proportions (比例)
- The 禺 component occupies approximately 60% of the character width
- The 辵 radical wraps around from left and bottom
- Overall shape is slightly taller than wide (修长)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. ❌ Making strokes too thick or dramatic
2. ❌ Uneven stroke widths
3. ❌ Sharp, angular corners (should be rounded)
4. ❌ Disproportionate components
5. ❌ Forgetting the embracing structure of 辵
